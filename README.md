# AIRLINE-DELAYS-ANALYSIS

## Executive Summary
Flight delays pose significant challenges to travelers, airlines, and the aviation industry at large, leading to financial losses, customer dissatisfaction, and operational inefficiencies. This analysis aims to uncover key trends, delay patterns, and their root causes using real-world flight data. By identifying these factors, we can provide actionable insights to improve airline operations and enhance passenger experience.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes flight delay data to:

- Identify busiest months and airports for flights.
- Determine which months experience the highest delay rates.
- Explore delay patterns across different airlines.
- Examine primary causes of delays, including weather, carrier issues, and late aircraft.
- Assess the impact of weather on delays at various airports.
- Compare delay occurrences during peak and off-peak seasons.
- Investigate geographical patterns in delay trends.
- Identify airports and airlines with the best on-time performance.
  
## Data Source
FP20 Analytics â€“ Real-world airline delay dataset containing:
Flight carrier details
Delay reasons (weather, carrier, late aircraft, etc.)
Airport names and locations
Yearly and monthly flight data

## Data Analysis
The analysis explores key metrics such as:

Flight Traffic & Seasonality

Identifying busiest months and airports based on total flight volume.
Analyzing flight traffic across different seasons.
Delay Trends & Causes

Calculating delay percentages per month to find the highest delay periods.
Examining delay patterns across airlines to identify carriers with high or low performance.
Breaking down delay reasons (carrier, weather, late aircraft) to determine major contributors.
Geographical & Seasonal Patterns

Analyzing weather-related delays by airport and region.
Comparing delays during peak vs. off-peak travel seasons.
Identifying regional delay trends (e.g., coastal vs. inland airports).
On-Time Performance & Operational Efficiency

Determining the percentage of total flights delayed over 15 minutes.
Identifying airports and airlines with the best on-time performance.

## Findings & Recommendations
## Key Findings:
Certain months and airports experience higher traffic and delays, highlighting seasonal patterns.
Some airlines have consistently lower on-time performance, requiring operational improvements.
Weather-related delays significantly affect specific airports and regions.
Late aircraft delays contribute a large share to overall flight disruptions.

## Recommendations:
Optimize Flight Scheduling: Adjust flight operations based on historical delay trends to reduce congestion.
Improve Airline Efficiency: Airlines with high delays should enhance turnaround times and operational processes.
Weather-Responsive Planning: Airports heavily affected by weather should invest in better forecasting and contingency planning.
Passenger Communication: Implement real-time delay alerts and improved customer service to manage passenger expectations.
By leveraging these insights, airlines and airports can enhance operational efficiency, minimize delays, and improve overall customer experience.
